# QMQTT-collection
 Qt MQTT 
 
 MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M) protocol utilizing the publish-and-subscribe paradigm. 
 Its purpose is to provide a channel with minimal communication overhead.  
 Generally, MQTT is used on top of a TCP connection. However, the base requirement is defined as an ordered, lossless, bidirectional connection.  
 The Qt MQTT module provides a standard compliant implementation of the MQTT protocol specification. 
 It enables applications to act as telemetry displays and devices to publish telemetry data. 
 The supported versions are MQTT 3.1, MQTT 3.1.1, and MQTT 5.0.  
 Note: Qt MQTT is part of the Qt for Automation offering and not Qt. For further details please see Qt for Automation.
